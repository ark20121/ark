# Arch (still in production)
A Customized beautiful theme for KDE based distros

# How to 

- Download Arch Global theme from the store.
- Go to System Settings -> Appearance -> Global Theme

## Dark Mode 

- Go to **Application Style** and select Kvantum-dark
- You can download Kvantum themes from kde store or clone it from  the repo
- Install and apply the Kvantum theme using Kvantum Manager 
- Now switch to **Plasma Style**  and select *Arch*
- Now switch to **Color**  and select any dark mode color of your choice 
- The default window decoration is *Breeze* but you can download *Sierra Breeze* or *Enhanced Sierra breeze* to enjoy more customization.
- **Fonts** - I'd suggest you to get an alternative font that looks similar to *Google Sans*
- **Icons** - There are multiple icon packs available in the store but the favorite ones include *Fluent dark*, *Flat Remix*, *Beauty line* + *Candy Icons* + *Sweet blue filled folders*
    - To enjoy better view go to  *~/.local/share/icons/BeautyLine*
    - open *index.theme*  
    - There'll be line similar to *Inherits=breeze,adwaita,ubuntu-mono,yaru,Mint-X,elementary,hicolor*
    - Add *candy-icons* after the "=" symbol
    - This sets a fallback, incase some icons are not found in BeautyLine, it'll look for the same icon in candy-icons and so on and so-forth
    - similary you can customize other icons themes



## Light Mode 
- Switch to **Arch-light** in *Plasma Style* 
- and select and light mode color schemes in *Colors* to enjoy light mode.
